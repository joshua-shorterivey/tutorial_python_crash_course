This is a text file containing a few lines about what I have learned to this point. It's actually difficult to summarize because I feel there is too much to put here, but I know it is also just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to what Python has to offer. I'm also not sure if I should have made the sentences conform to a one-line one-sentence structure. Oh, well. At any rate, with this crash course I have learned about: strings, integers, functions, loops, and classes among other things. The information about classes was not exactly knew, but it really drilled home how much of Python I have learned and lost already. Need to do a better job at simply studying what I have already been exposed too. Forward momentum is good, but it needs to be accompanied with study of what has previously been acquireed. Important lesson to learn right there.
